This is my First Flask Webpage. It's a webpage where I pulled data from an existin website via web scraping.

To start: 
    cd into it
    run "export FLASK_ENV=development" 
    run "flask run" 

/             -> page is where you can give your name and color stored in a session
/list         -> to see all the scraped data
/list_id      -> to see the details of a product
/dropsession  -> to delete the session
/anythingelse -> brings you back where you belong :)
