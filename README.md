# Flask WebPage - Web Concepten 

This is my First Flask Webpage. It's a webpage where I pulled data from an existing website via web scraping.

## Getting Started

    cd path/to/folder
    run "export FLASK_ENV=development" 
    run "flask run"
    
    /             -> page is where you can give your name and color stored in a session
    /list         -> to see all the scraped data
    /list_id      -> to see the details of a product
    /dropsession  -> to delete the session
    /anythingelse -> brings you back where you belong :)
